# ContactsApplication
By Jakub Szmidla

Desktop Application made with JavaFX.
It is a contact book. You can add contacts using a "+" button in the left bottom of the screen.
You can choose whether the contact is a person or an organization. After the data validation, the contact
is added and from now you can search for it by typing a pattern into the search field.

It is possible to edit and delete contacts.
The contact list is being serialized and saved to the "contacts.bin" file.
